## What is Petty?

Petty is a full stack solo project, enabling a user to insert their number plate, start point, destination and number of passengers for a journey to find out how much the journey will cost per person based on the current cost of petrol.  The app uses an IPA I made due to the cost of using an actual API that returns MPG data of cars using a number plate.
